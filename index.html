    <h1>PIL Reflection Compiler</h1>
    <p>The PIL is to be submitted on CANVAS as a single text block without titles. 
      It is potentially annoying to write each section separately and copy-paste it all together. 
      This compiler will provide a space to write your PIL and later compile it into a single chunk of text to copy into CANVAS for submission. 
      Text is saved locally to each device, so you can write when convenient and not worry about losing progress. <br>
      ⚠️ CAUTION ⚠️ Data does not save <b>between</b> devices or browsers. I am also not liable for your resulting mark or lost data.
      The form can be cleared for subsequent PIL reflections.</p>
