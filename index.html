    <h1>PIL Reflection Compiler</h1>
    <p>The PIL is to be submitted on CANVAS as a single text block without titles. It is potentially annoying to write each section separately and copy-paste it all together. This compiler will provide a space to write your PIL and later compile it into a single chunk of text to copy into CANVAS for submission. Text is saved locally to each device, so you can write when convenient and not worry about losing progress. The form can be cleared for subsequent PIL reflections.</p>
